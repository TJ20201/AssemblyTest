# AssemblyTest

This is simply just me testing out Assembly coding. <br />

# Building
Build every file with NASM, command template below: <br />
```
nasm [file].asm -fbin -o [directory]/[file].com
``` 
`[file]` is the file name (eg. `main`) <br />
`[directory]` is the target directory (eg. `C:/Assembly`) <br />
